# drone-server-customized
Drone is a Continuous Delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses a simple YAML configuration file, a superset of docker-compose, to define and execute Pipelines inside Docker containers.
The customized version of drone server is intended simply to demonstrate how one can change color scheme of drone-ui's appearance. At the moment, colors of console logs are changed to inverse (black on white).
No result is deployed anywhere, so feel free to customize further.
